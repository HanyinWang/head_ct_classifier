CT (Computed Topography) is a widely used non-invasive diagnosis approach. Head CT (Computed Topography) is the major radiology imaging diagnositc method for head trauma and corresponding complications. Head trauma including Intraparenchymal hemorrhage, Intraventricular hemorrhage, Subdural hematoma, Extradural hematoma, Subarachnoid hematoma, cranial fracture, midline shift and mass effect.
In this project, I used pre-trained and fine tuned image classification models on head CT.
